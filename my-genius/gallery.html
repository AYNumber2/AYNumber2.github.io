            <p>1. A3 Boba Milk Tea</p>
            <img id="img" class="sizing" src="/my-genius/images/boba.png">
            <p>
                This is the bread and butter of a boba tea shop. It is simply milk tea, boba (tapioca, pearls whatever you want to call it), ice, and a bit of brown sugar. The amount of brown sugar is what can be adjusted when they ask you if you want to adjust sugar. So with some drinks that are naturally sweet, I'd recommend you get lower sugar. For this drink I'd recommend 50%-70% sugar depending on if you would like it slightly more or slightly less sweet!

            <p>2. A13 Brown Sugar Fresh Milk with boba</p>
            <img id="img" class="sizing" src="/my-genius/images/a13.jfif">
            <p>
                I brought up this drink because I think that people SHOULDN'T order this. It could be a nice drink depending on your mood, but to be honest, I think we charge way too much for it. It is simply just milk, brown sugar drizzles on the inside of the cup (so it's pretty sweet), ice, and boba. This drink is also uncustomizeable as removing ice changes the consistency of the drink and you cannot change how much brown sugar we put in as it changes the appearance of the drink as well. :(

            <img id="img" class="sizing" src="/my-genius/images/c3.png">
            <p>
                This is a popular drink from our Fresh Lemon Series as bellevue square. It contains lemon chunks, lemon juice, honey water, ice, brown sugar, and green tea. This drink is pretty sweet so I'd recommend about 50%-70% sweetness again!

            <img id="img" class="sizing" src="/my-genius/images/k5.png">
            <p>
                A very popular drink from our Smoothie series! It's one of my favorite drinks so you should definitely try it! It contains puff cream (the yellow swirls), strawberries, strawberry syrup, milk, heavy cream, egg pudding, and ice! I think that it is pretty sweet so I'd recommend 30% sugar.

            <p>
                I added in a little suprise! Just kidding, I'm sorry to disappoint but I don't actually know the ingredients to our bubble waffles. However, I do know how to make them and they are dang delicious so if you would ever like a delicious sweet waffle, come visit Happy Lemon (come on Saturdays, I work then :3)
