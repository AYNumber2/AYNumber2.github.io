            Hi! My name is Alan Yuen. I'm a senior at Eastside Preparatory School. Recently, I've been working at a boba tea shop called Happy Lemon at Bellevue Square. Ever since I first had bubble tea for the first time, I've always wanted to try making it myself or simply just working at a boba shop. Over the summer, I got the opportunity to work at Happy Lemon and I became a barista-in-training. Now, I've already passed my bar test, and today I'm here to give you a little insider info on how we make bubble tea!
        </p>

        <p>
            Obviously, I cannot diverge too many secrets, but I can still describe our process in general, and I'll talk about 4 drinks in specific in the gallery page!
        </p>

        <p id="steps"> General Steps: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add toppings (including extra toppings that customers ask for and yes you can do that!)</li>
            <li>For most drinks, add ice</li>
            <li>Add drink base (milk tea, green tea, black tea, etc.) or create drink base (eg. strawberry smoothie)</li>
            <li>Add crema or non-dairy milk if applicable</li>
            <li>Voila! Drink Complete! Go seal it and give to customers to enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
